# LemnCord
Discord **client** written in Python. Made for educational purposes. Probably not gonna turn into something useful.

# How to run
Put your user token in `token.txt`

In LemnCord folder launch `LemnCord.bat` or `LemnCord.bash` â€” if you use bash

To exit: **CTRL + C**

# Why?
The Official Discord app is bad. It wastes ram. Why not do a lighter and more platform friendly (less user friendly ðŸ˜¬) app?

# Can I see the source and use it?
Yes.
