# LemnCord
A Discord "client" written in Python. Made for educational purposes. Probably not gonna turn into something useful.

# How to run
Put your user token in `bruh.py`

`pip install requests websocket_client`

`python3 menu.py`

To exit: CTRL+C

# Why?
The Official Discord app is bad. It wastes ram. Why not do a lighter and more platform friendly (less user friendly ðŸ˜¬) app?

# Can I see the source and use it?
Yes.
